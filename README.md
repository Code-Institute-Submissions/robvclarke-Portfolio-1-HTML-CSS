# 3 Caminos

![Responsive Designs](/assets/images/readme-banner.png)

Each summer, between 2017 - 2019, I went on a long walk over several days with my friends. This website documents those 3 adventures. Hopefully, it will wet your appetite for an adventure of your own.

## Project Kickoff

My idea for the Portfolio 1 project was to code a website providing information on a series of 3 hikes on routes known as Caminos that I walked over three summers. 

## Moodboard and Inspiration

I began by created a pintrest page so I had a moodboard for the design where I gathered Spanish branding, design, and web patters I thought could be interesting to experiment with.

The link to the Pintrest moodboard I created can be found here [Moodboard](https://pin.it/nPuxeAm)

## Sitemap, Features and Priority Guide

I then went into Figma and created a sitemap and priority guide of features based around the user goals I wrote up for each page.

The link to the Sitemap and Priorty guide I designed in Figma can be found here [Sitemap_Priority_Guide](https://www.figma.com/file/reC3Fy6xJeDvUtkPXHmQZE/Main-File?node-id=0%3A1)

### Features for Landing page

1. Navigation header to allow the user to navigate to the area of the site of most interest to them with ease.
2. Hero image to showcase the beauty of the camino and makes the user want to know more/figure out how they can visit themself.
3. Site explanation explaining the purpose of the site and the kind of information the user can expect to find.
4. Section areas giving a brief synopsis of a particular camino and call to action button where they can click to learn more.

### Features for Camino pages

1. Navigation header to allow the user to navigate to the area of the site of most interest to them with ease.
2. Page title and description with text explaining the purpose of the page and the kind of information the user can expect to find.
3. A hero image to draw the user in and showcase the beauty of the particular camino. 
4. Key Stats - a section focusing on bite sized statistics related to this route.
5. An iframe displaying a google map of the route. 
6. A gallery section for each route showing the fun, beauty and challenge of the walks.

### Features for the Contact Page

1. A form users can fill out to request further information about any point of interest they have. 
2. An input field for their name. 
3. An input field for their email address.
4. An dropdown menu where they can select their camino of interest. 
5. A input area for the users message that can be expanded if they wish to send a long email.
6. A submit button to complete the form.

## Sketched Wireframes

In the interest of quickly getting ideas out I began sketching wireframes with pencil and paper for each page of the website based off of the features I had decided on in the priority guide exercise.

## Color Pallete 

For the Color Pallete I wanted to use the colors of the flag of Spain which the three caminos passed through but with a more pastel tone. 
I went onto the online resource [Color_Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/paletteshttps://colorhunt.co/palettes/) 
and selected colors from a couple of warm and dark palletes settling on my final pallete of:

## Typography

For the choice of typography for the site I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to base my selection.

For the title and headings I wanted something rustic and Spanish.
I chose [Dokdo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dokdo?query=dokdo) 

For the body copy I wanted something clear, legible and modern. I chose [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=barlow)

![Typography](/assets/images/Typography.jpg)

## Photography

All photos were taken my myself on a OnePlus mobile phone while on the caminos. I had to go back in Google Photos, download and organise hundreds of them
to find the ones I wanted to use which I then edited in photoshop.

![Editing Process](/assets/images/photo_editing.png)

## Icons

I designed the icons for the site with the caligraphy brush tool in Illustrator. I wanted a kind of Piscasso ink drawing vibe to them/kind of holiday notebook aesthetic.

![Icon Creation](/assets/images/Illustrator_Icons.png)

## Designs

I then put together the designs for the landing page, the three camino pages and the contact page in Figma.

## Clickable Prototype

Once I had the designs I made a clickable prototype in Figma to figure out some of the hoover states of buttons and see how the pages flow together.

Link for the clickable prototype can be accessed here [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/reC3Fy6xJeDvUtkPXHmQZE/Main-File?page-id=10%3A2&node-id=10%3A8675&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=10%3A8675&show-proto-sidebar=1) 


![Prototype](/assets/images/clickable_prototype.png)

## Responsive Designs

I then designed the landing screen across variety of breakpoints to ensure I'd be happy with the responsive layout I would be trying to code

![Responsive Landing Page](/assets/images/responsive_landing_page.png)

Following this I designed the camino pages in a similar responsive way. The three camino pages 
will have the same layout just different content.

The final thing to design then was the contact page across the breakpoints. This hopefully will be the easiest page to have behave repsonsively in the way I want it to.

User Goals

## User Stories

### First time visitor goals

1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to find out easily what the purpose of the site is.
2. As a first time visitor, I want the navigation to be easy to grasp and feel smooth moving between pages.
3. As a first time visitor, I want the visuals of the site to get me excited about my own potential trip. 
4. As a first time visitor, I want the content of the site to be clearly seperated into sections that make sense.
5. As a first time visitor, I want there to be a form where I can reach out for more information to the site owner if I require it.
6. As a first time visitor, I want the site to be responsive so that I can browse the content with ease on my mobile.

### Returning visitor goals

1. As a returning visitor, I want the routes taken on the caminos to be clearly marked out on maps so I can review my own route regularly and see if I want to make changes.
1. As a returning visitor, I want the stats of each route to be clearly marked so I can compare and discuss with the people I will be walking with. 
3. As a returning visitor, I want there to be enough variety/quality in the images displayed for each route that I will want to come back to get new ideas about where I might stop off myself.


## Testing

I optimised my images for web in photoshop by using the 'export as' feature setting the quality to 50 percent and dividing the size of the images in half. This paid off in the testing 
where lighthouse gave it a '95' performance rating. The only aspect it scored badly was on SEO which I know is from me not adding the meta tags to the html which was a result of paucity of time. 

![Lighthouse Testing](/assets/images/lighthouse_testing.png)

I then ran the code through the W3 code validator for the html:

![w3 validator test](/assets/images/testing_w3.png)

Errors 1 & 5 were a lack of section headings which I think was a result of me using SVGs for my section headings which I forgot to place within headers and did not remedy as I ran out of time. 

Errors 2,3 & 4 were as a result of having an a element with my button which was the solution I arrived at and it works but must be semantically not best practice which I would have fixed had I had more time. 

The CSS testing is something I realise I should have been validating as I went as I had 27 errors at the end. However, none of these errors were affecting the behaviour of the site as far as I could tell but I know I should have figured out how to fix them if I had managed my time better.

![w3 CSS test](/assets/images/css_validator.png)

The only bug of the site that I was not able to figure out how to fix was the form background color on mobile as I had the height controlled by 80vh and on smaller screens this was too small to contain the content of the form. It was the last bug I noticed and couldn't figure out how to fix it in time as when I switched between a pixel setting for the height for mobile and then the vh parameter at larger screen sizes it caused more errors which I did not understand how to fix either.

![w3 CSS test](/assets/images/contact_form_background_height.png)

A learning I took from the project was to make sure I test regularly on a mobile device rather than just resizing the browser as you gain far more actually seeing it on your phone. 

I ran it through the validator on [Web Accessibilty](https://www.webaccessibility.com/) and was delighted that the site was given a 100 percent health score.

## Technologies

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to make up the basic elements and structure of the website.

- [CSS 2.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) for custom styling and to alter the bootstrap stylings to suit my needs.

- [Bootstrap v5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for its grid features and handy components. 

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) was used to create the design of all pages on the site as well as the sitemap and other assets.

- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com) was used to create the icons for the site

- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com)) was used to edit the images used for the site

- [Github](https://github.com) was used for version control, storing the code and deployment of the live site via Github pages

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used to code the site

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the font Dokdo and the font Barlow

- [Pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com) was used to create the moodboard at the start of the project. 

- [Am I responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is) was used for the banner image of the site across various devices at the start of the readme.

## Deployment

I deployed my project to Github pages by doing the following steps:

1. I logged into Github and opened my repository for my Portfolio 1 project.
2. I clicked into settings.
3. Once in settings, I scrolled to the section titled 'Pages'. 
4. For the source, I selected Main Branch. 
5. This caused the link to the live website to appear on the page. 

## If I had more time

If I had more time I would have liked to have figured out a way that clicking on an image in my photo gallery would have brought you back to the page after it took over the tab. As a fix I used a target=_blank so that the image opens in a new tab but I still dont think it is an ideal user experience.

I omitted some nice to have features like the video gallery that I had in the priority guide I created and spoke about in the beginning of my readme. This was mainly because when I reviewed the videos I had they would have only have been funny to close friends and I wanted to make the site more universal. 

I also omitted a section I was calling 'The crew' which was in the wireframes where I would have given an introduction to each of the companions we had on each march but as the make up of the groups was very similar each year I decided it was not important. 

## Credits

I used the 'Bootstrap' library to aid me in replicating my designs as best I could with the code.

I coded the photo gallery section of the camino pages with the help of this Youtube tutorial

Link for the Youtube Tutorial for Photo Gallery [Photo Gallery Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgXHgKad7N0&ab_channel=JulioCodes) 

The icon in the photo gallery when you hover on an image was made by Ionic Icons

The image at the start of my readme with the site on different devices was made using [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#)

I would like to thank my mentor Reuben who was very supportive, informative and encouraging throughout.
