# Project Kickoff

My idea for the Portfolio 1 project was to code a website providing information on a series of 3 hikes on routes known as Caminos that I walked over three summers. 

## Moodboard and Inspiration

I began by created a pintrest page so I had a moodboard for the design where I gathered Spanish branding, design, and web patters I thought could be interesting to experiment with.

## Sitemap and Priority Guide

I then went into Figma and created a sitemap and priority guide of features based around the user goals I wrote up for each page.

## Sketched Wireframes

In the interest of quickly getting ideas out I began sketching wireframes with pencil and paper for each page of the website based off of the features I had decided on in the priority guide exercise.

## Color Pallete 

For the Color Pallete I wanted to use the colors of the flag of Spain which the three caminos passed through but with a more pastel tone. 
I went onto the online resource [Color_Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/paletteshttps://colorhunt.co/palettes/) 
and selected colors from a couple of warm and dark palletes settling on my final pallete of:

## Typography

For the choice of typography for the site I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to base my selection.

For the title and headings I wanted something rustic and Spanish.
I chose [Dokdo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dokdo?query=dokdo) 

For the body copy I wanted something clear, legible and modern. I chose [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=barlow)

## Photography

All photos were taken my myself on a OnePlus mobile phone while on the caminos. I had to go back in Google Photos, download and organise hundreds of them
to find the ones I wanted to use which I then edited in photoshop.

## Icons

I designed the icons for the site with the caligraphy brush tool in Illustrator. I wanted a kind of Piscasso ink drawing vibe to them/kind of holiday notebook aesthetic.

## Designs

I then put together the designs for the landing page, the three camino pages and the contact page in Figma.
